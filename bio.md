# Syllabus Questions
1. **What on the syllabus are you most interested in working on?**

    I am most interested in the group project to design a functioning website.
2. **What on the syllabus do you find confusing/unclear?**

    If we need paid services during the course, for say the project, do we need to pay for it or will it be supplied for us?
3. **What on the syllabus scares you?**

    The frequency of the commits and the scope of the project.
